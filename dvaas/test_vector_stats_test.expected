-- ExplainTestVectorStats test ------------------------------
5 (55.56%) of 9 test vectors passed
The System Under Test (SUT):
- forwarded:                          for 4 test vectors (expected: 5)
- punted:                             for 3 test vectors (expected: 3 - 4)
- dropped:                            for 3 test vectors (expected: 1 - 2)
- came close* to expected behavior:   for 3 failing test vectors
  (*produced expected number of forwarded/punted packets, but with unexpected header/payload values)
